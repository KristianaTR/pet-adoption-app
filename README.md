# Pet Adoption App

This project is a Pet Adoption App developed during an internship at Accenture. <br>

The project encompasses both the client/frontend and server/backend components. <br>
The application leverages the Petfinder.com API to retrieve data about pets, and user interactions on the client side are stored in a MongoDB database.
